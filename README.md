# Bhagwat Sapkota Final Project

This is the final project that combines everything learned so far.

# DevOps Lifecycle with AWS

In this project, youâ€™ll be creating the infra using terraform and will perform application/tool stack configuration using shell scripts and will effectively use Jenkins for running automated CICD for both the application and infra deployment. Provisioning a managed EKS cluster and setting up a mutable environment setup which ensures the HA and Resilience of the application. 

Post-Mortem SRE Scoped Project: 


Install and configure the monitoring tool stack (Splunk and Dynatrace) to monitor the Application and Infra which is very essential for every production software system.
